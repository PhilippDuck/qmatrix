# Changelog

## [2.4.1] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed
- **Inherited Targets**: Inherited role requirements (Soll-Level) are now correctly displayed in the Skill Matrix. Also fixed an issue where role lookups by name (legacy data) were not working.
- **Double Download**: Fixed an issue where exporting data triggered the file download twice.
- **Export Name**: The exported filename now includes the Project Title (e.g., `ProjectName_Backup_DATE.json`) instead of a generic name.
- **Tooltips**: Added tooltips to individual target indicators in the Skill Matrix for better clarity.
